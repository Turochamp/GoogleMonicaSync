# Google OAuth Application Setup Instructions

Use these instructions to set up API credentials for use with the syncing script.  
The following instructions are based on the [Create a project and enable the API](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-project) and [Create credentials](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-credentials) articles.

## Create a new Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project

To use the Google People API (formerly Contacts API), you need a Google Cloud Platform project. This project forms the basis for creating, enabling, and using all GCP services, including managing APIs, adding and removing collaborators, and managing permissions.

1. Open the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Next to `Google Cloud Platform`, click the down arrow ðŸ”½. A dialog listing current projects appears.
3. Click `New Project`. The New Project screen appears.
4. In the `Project Name` field, enter a descriptive name for your project. For example, enter "Google Monica Sync".
5. Click `Create`. The console navigates to the Dashboard page and your project is created within a few minutes.

## Enable the Google People API

1. Next to "Google Cloud Platform," click the down arrow ðŸ”½ and open your newly created project.
2. In the top-left corner, click `Menu` > `APIs & Services`.
3. Click `Enable APIs and Services`. The `Welcome to API Library` page appears.
4. In the search field, enter `People API` and press enter.
5. Click `Google People API`. The API page appears.
6. Click `Enable`. The "Overview" page appears.

## Create credentials

Credentials are used to obtain an access token from a Google authorization server. This token is then used to call the Google People API. All Google Workspace APIs access data are owned by end-users.

### Configure the OAuth consent screen

The python script uses the OAuth protocol. When you start the script, it requests authorizations for `read/write contacts` from a Google Account. Google then displays a consent screen to you including a summary of your created project and the requested scopes of access. You must configure this consent screen for the authentication to work.

To configure the OAuth consent screen:

1. On the "Overview" page click `Credentials`. The credential page for your project appears.
2. Click `Configure Consent Screen`. The "OAuth consent screen" screen appears.
3. Select `External` as the user type for your app.
4. Click `Create`. A second "OAuth consent screen" screen appears.
5. Fill out the required form field (leave others blank):
        - Enter "GMSync" in the `App name` field.
        - Enter your personal email address in the `User support email` field.
        - Enter your personal email address in the `Developer contact information` field.
6. Click `Save and Continue`. The "Scopes" page appears.
7. Click `Add or Remove Scopes`. The "Update selected scopes" page appears.
8. Filter for "People API" and select the scope ".../auth/contacts".
9. Click `Update`. A list of scopes for your app appears. Check if the scope ".../auth/contacts" is now listed in "Your sensitive scopes".
10. Click `Save and Continue`. The "Edit app registration" page appears.
11. At the "Test user" section click `Add Users`, enter the email of the Google Account whose contacts you want to sync, and click `Add`.
    > Hint: If you get a `403 forbidden` during consent later, you may have entered the wrong email here.
12. Click `Save and Continue`. The "OAuth consent screen" appears.
13. Click `Back to Dashboard`.
14. Back at the "OAuth consent screen" screen, click `PUBLISH APP` and then `CONFIRM`.
    > This step is necessary because when in "Testing"-status, Google limits the token lifetime to seven days. You don't need to complete the app verification process.

### Create an OAuth client ID credential

1. In the left-hand navigation, click `Credentials`. The "Credentials" page appears.
2. Click `Create Credentials` and select `OAuth client ID`. The "Create OAuth client ID" page appears.
3. Click the Application type drop-down list and select "Desktop application".
4. In the name field, type a name for the credential. For example type "Python Syncing Script"
5. Click `Create`. The "OAuth client created" screen appears. This screen shows the Client ID and Client Secret.
6. Click `DOWNLOAD JSON`. This copies a client secret JSON file to your desktop. Note the location of this file.
7. Rename the client secret JSON file to `credentials.json`.

## Get the sync token and run initial sync (**without** docker)

0. Install Python 3.9 or newer
1. Copy `credentials.json` inside the `data` folder of the repository
2. In the main repository folder rename `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your desired settings (a Monica token can be retrieved in your account settings).
3. Do a `pip install -r requirements.txt` inside the main repository directory.
4. Open a command prompt inside the main repository directory and run `python GMSync.py -i`.
5. On the first run the script will print a Google consent URL in the console. Copy this URL and open it in a browser on the host machine.
6. In your browser window, log in to your target Google account (the Google Account whose contacts you want to sync).
7. At "Google hasnâ€™t verified this app" click `Continue`.
8. At "GMSync wants access to your Google Account" click `Continue`.
9. An authorization code should have been transmitted via local server, follow the prompts in your terminal to complete the initial sync.

## Get the sync token and run initial sync (**with** docker)

0. Install docker
1. In your chosen main folder, create two folders named `data` and `logs`.
2. Copy `credentials.json` inside a `data` folder of your main directory.
3. [Download](https://github.com/antonplagemann/GoogleMonicaSync/blob/main/.env.example) the `.env.example` file, rename to `.env`, put it in your main folder, and fill in your desired settings (a Monica token can be retrieved in your account settings).
    > This project is using a **non-root** container, so `data` and `logs` must have read-write permissions for UID 5678 (container user).
    > For example, you can use `sudo chown -R 5678 data logs` or `sudo chmod -R 777 data logs` inside your main directory to set the appropriate permissions.
4. Open a command prompt inside the main directory run initial sync using the following command (on Windows replace `$(pwd)` with `%cd%`)

    ```bash
    docker run -v "$(pwd)/data":/usr/app/data -v "$(pwd)/logs":/usr/app/logs -p 56411:56411 --env-file .env -it antonplagemann/google-monica-sync sh -c "python -u GMSync.py -i"
    ```

5. On the first run the script will print a Google consent URL in the console. Copy this URL and open it in a browser on the host machine.
6. In your browser window, log in to your target Google account (the Google Account whose contacts you want to sync).
7. At "Google hasnâ€™t verified this app" click `Continue`.
8. At "GMSync wants access to your Google Account" click `Continue`.
9. An authorization code should have been transmitted via local server, follow the prompts in your terminal to complete the initial sync.
